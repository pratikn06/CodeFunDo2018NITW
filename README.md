Disaster Management Application -
  Lack of proper information and panic among the people proves to be a greater disaster than the Natural Disaster itself!
  
  - This app intends to monitor disaster relief mechanism. 
  - The app server has a database of all the hospitals and relief centres in a region. 
  - Citizens having working mobile phones can access the app to know the nearest relief centres/hospitals. They can also report their          status to the concerned authorities through the app.
  - Photos of all the citizens who reach to the centres are taken and uploaded to the server, so a person with the help of say a facebook      photo of his friends or family, find out whether they are safe in some relief centre or not.
  - Citizens can also send SMS to the server from the app to know basic details about the disaster. Since a large number of SMS can be          expected, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is employed for the answering mechanism.
  
  
  
  Future Work - 
    Currently the app is supposed to get the location of the user when the user has active internet connection and shares his location. This can be made efficient by collaborating with government and mobile companies so that all users in the affected area will get monitored by the app and get the details and directions of the nearest relief centre through SMS, without the need of internet connection.
